    <p className="text-[20px]  font-bold font-serif">Hello there! I'm Rahul, an aspiring web and app developer on an exciting journey of learning and exploration in the vast world of computer science. Currently immersed in the dynamic realm of web development and app creation, I am passionate about turning ideas into interactive and functional digital experiences. Every line of code I write is a step toward honing my skills and creating something meaningful.When I'm not coding, I enjoy diving into the immersive worlds of high graphics PC games. It's not just entertainment for me; it's a way to appreciate the artistry and technology that go into creating virtual realities.Outside of my work in the digital realm, I enjoy spending time immersed in good books. I believe in the power of words to inspire, educate, and transport us to different worlds. If you have any book recommendations, feel free to share them with me!</p>
